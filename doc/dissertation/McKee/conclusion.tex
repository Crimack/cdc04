\chapter{Conclusion}
This body of work has implemented a novel method of training models for use in classifying nominal data sets, and has experimented with using this method together with a number of established classification techniques. Through these experiments it has been shown that the implemented method of iteratively imputing and retraining classifiers does not lead to greater classification accuracy, but does decrease the entropy of classified data sets. This may be useful for some specific domains in which data generally has a low statistical entropy anyway, but is probably not useful in the vast majority of cases.

As a project, all objectives have been fulfilled. A functional, distributable Weka plugin has been developed which integrates into the system through its package manager and passing all unit tests imposed by the system. It is usable from both the CLI and GUI, and allows for easy configuration of its parameters and the parameters of its internal classifiers. It has also been used for experiments as intended, and some minor insights have been gleaned from these.
