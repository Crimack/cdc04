\section{Design}
This body of work is mainly interested in common classifiers, and in trying to use them in a novel way. It therefore makes sense to extend a package in which these are already implemented, and in which they are easily accessible. The Weka project therefore suits this purpose since it has well maintained, efficient implementations of most machine learning algorithms, as well as handling file I/O, and having both command line and graphical user interfaces. Since these are written in Java, it follows that the plugin should also be written in Java.

It also follows that any files which are used for testing should be in either .csv, or .arff format. The former is commonly used in data processing while the latter is a proprietary Weka format which is very similar, but differs in that it contains additional data at the top of the file pertaining to the dataset. Both are supported by Weka, and therefore either is usable.
