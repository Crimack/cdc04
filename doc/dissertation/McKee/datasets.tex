% info about data sets used for experiments

Figure \ref{dsets} shows some information about the data which was used for the experiments in Section \ref{experiments}. All of the data sets used for testing contain only nominal data, although the categories vary in size between attributes. There is also a fairly large range of data set shapes and sizes, which should provide a range of results to prevent false positives.
