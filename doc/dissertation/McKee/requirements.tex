The goal of this project is to study the effects of iteratively building common classifiers and comparing the performance of classifiers built this way against the performance of the same classifier, but without attempting to impute missing training data. The main aims of the software to be developed will therefore be:

\begin{itemize}
\item A Weka plugin will be developed. This should integrate smoothly into any version of Weka > 3.7.1, and will be made freely available.
\item The classifier developed within the plugin should be usable from both the CLI and GUI.
\item Running experiments using the plugin should be easy, and have well explained documentation.
\item Allow any Weka classifier which is valid to use for a given data set to be used within the newly implemented classifier, and for this to be easily configurable.
\item Run a number of experiments to compare the performance of the iteratively trained classifier against some control cases on the same data sets.
\end{itemize}
