I would like to thank my project supervisor, Dr. Cassio Polpo de Campos, for all of his guidance
and support during this project.

I’d also like to thank Queens University Belfast for assigning me a project that was of great
interest to me, and also for the usage of their facilities during this time.

I’d also like to thank my family for their support, and more importantly the refreshments
which they prepared.
