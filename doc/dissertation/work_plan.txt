WORK PLAN


Project description:
This project aims to investigate the usage of machine learning techniques on incomplete data sets of discrete data. It will attempt to fill in missing data in certain data sets by using training data to build a model, which we will then apply to the target data set. We will keep using this model to generate predictions on produced data sets recursively, and will stop whenever the produced data set stops changing. It is expected that the prediction will trend towards the mean, and more reliable results will be achieved.

Given sufficient time, it is also intended that this approach can be used to produce 'hidden variables', similarly to how neural networks produce hidden layers in order to create relationships between data. New data will be added to the target data set by this method, and we will investigate how useful this hidden data is.

A package in Java for the machine learning platform Weka will be created in order to accomplish the goals described above.

It is also currently intended to produce graphical representations of the results which are observed using this method vs results achieved using existing methods. This will be performed using Python and existing libraries such as matplotlib and Pandas.


Expected development timeline:
This section is subject to change. I'm studying three modules before Christmas and one module after, so most of the work will probably be done in the second semester. Also, it'll be important to react to the results that we're seeing, so the end of the project will really depend on observations.

Semester 1
Week 1 (31/10/2016) - Get familiar with Weka and also previous projects which have been produced in a similar area.
Week 2              - Develop an understanding of machine learning + classification. Do tutorials and read up on things in that field
Week 3              - Start development in Weka
Week 4              - More development
Week 5 (28/11/2016) - Produce a mostly working implementation of the prediction algorithm in Java
Week 6 (5/12/2016)  - Fine tune + refactor implementation, preparation for demonstration.

Semester 2
January             - Start applying the predictive model to hidden variables. Investigate whether these hidden variables are meaningful/significant
February            - Further investigation
March               - ???


Acceptance Criteria:
The project will be successful if the implemented model is able to apply itself recursively to data sets until no further change is observed. If it is possible to use this on hidden variables, then this will be further success. Any further interpretation of these hidden layers will be interesting from a research perspective.
