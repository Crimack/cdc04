# Description (required)
Description=Iteratively trains a model by imputing missing training data, and continuing to iterate until two consecutive results are the same or the maximum iteration limit is reached. Supports all classifiers but probabilistic classifiers are recommended for best results. Also allows classifiers which do not support missing data to be used by randomly imputing missing values.
